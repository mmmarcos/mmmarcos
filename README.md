### 👋 Hi, I'm Marcos! 

I'm a Software Engineer working in the space industry 👨‍🚀. I am currently leading the [Visualization Toolkit for Space](https://timeloop.fr/vts/) of the French government space agency (CNES) at Spacebel.

I am a contributor to the official Python 🐍 Documentation translation to Spanish ([¡Ayúdanos a traducir!](https://python-docs-es.readthedocs.io/es/3.10/CONTRIBUTING.html)). Also, I am currently working in the translation of Daniel Stenberg's great [HTTP/3 explained](https://http3-explained.haxx.se/) book.
