### 👋 Hi, I'm Marcos! 

I'm a Software Engineer working in the space industry 👨‍🚀. I am currently leading the [Visualization Toolkit for Space](https://timeloop.fr/vts/) of the French government space agency (CNES) at Spacebel.

I am a contributor to the official Python 🐍 Documentation translation to Spanish ([📖¡Ayúdanos a traducir!](https://python-docs-es.readthedocs.io/es/3.10/CONTRIBUTING.html)).

```
- An argument is a collective series of statements intended to establish a proposition.
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is. It isn't just contradiction. 
- Look, if I *argue* with you, I must take up a contrary position!
- Yes but it isn't just saying 'No it isn't'
- Yes it is!
- No it isn't!

Argument - Monty Python
