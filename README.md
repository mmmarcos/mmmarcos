### 👋 Hi there, my name is Marcos 

I'm a Software Engineer working in the space industry 👨‍🚀. I am currently leading the [Visualization Toolkit for Space](https://timeloop.fr/vts/) of the French space agency (CNES) at [Spacebel](https://www.spacebel.com/).

I develop in Python and C++, I enjoy automating stuff 🤖 and looking for new ways to improve workflows 🙌. I also contribute to the official Python 🐍 Documentation translation to Spanish ([📖¡Ayúdanos a traducir!](https://python-docs-es.readthedocs.io/es/3.10/CONTRIBUTING.html)).

📫 How to reach me: dev@marcos.mozmail.com

> M: An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition... it isn't just contradiction.
> O: Look, if I *argue* with you, I must take up a contrary position!
> M: Yes but it isn't just saying 'No it isn't'
> O: Yes it is!
> M: No it isn't!
